# Terms of Service

- Our terms and conditions apply to all users who interact with the bot. We reserve the right to prohibit any server or user from using the bot if you do not follow the terms of service.
- Actions that harm the reliability of the service are not allowed, such as: brute forcing, denial of service and spamming.
- If you play AM4, you must uphold their terms of service.
    - Any form of cheating, manipulating or exploiting the game is not allowed
    - If you are found to be suspended in-game, or participated or aided in cheating, we will terminate your access.

Responsible vulnerability disclosure: We encourage everyone to find bugs in our bot and we ask that you make us aware of this privately.

The service is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the service or the use or other dealings in the service.

# Privacy policy

## The information we collect

The bot only responds to messages starting with the `$` command prefix. We collect minimal data to ensure the accuracy of the calculations.

- **Discord ID and username**: for login purposes and to retrieve your saved settings
- **Discord Role**: We determine your game mode by automatically checking if you have been assigned a role named `Easy` or `Realism`, to make sure calculations are correct.
- **User-provided settings**: Examples include your AM4 user id, load factor and assumed fuel price.

Your data is stored securely and are never shared to third parties.

### Logging

AM4Help follows a standard procedure for observability. When you issue a command, we log your discord ID and the associated command name to log files. We do not log the specific query parameters, such as the departing airport, constraints or flights per day.

The primary purpose for logging is to prevent spammers from overloading our servers.

## Data retention

We will only create an account for you when you first proactively issue a *valid* command (starting with a `$`).

You can stop all collection of data by not issuing commands to it.

If you wish to delete your data, you can submit a request to our email or open a ticket on our support server.

# Changes

The terms of service and privacy policy may be updated from time to time. You can subscribe to changes using the `Watch` feature on the Github repository.
